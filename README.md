## Corpus creation

### The goal of our corpus was to scrape posts from various finance-related subreddits to see if there is any correlation between the post's sentiment and the respective stock price.

- Scraped, processed, and annotated reddit posts regarding FAANG and MANA stocks. (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) and (Microsoft, Apple, Netflix, Amazon).

- Annotated and tagged a small batch of posts with either the Vader sentiment, or with Mturk. 

- Created a backend with Elastic search, and frontend with basic HTML.

- Dockerized and deployed
